# Scripts (Transformations and Calculations in Power BI)

This project was entirely built using Power BI. The following steps were performed within Power BI:

1. **Power Query Transformations**:
   - Cleaned the dataset by removing null values.
   - Filtered the data to include only the desired time range.
   - Merged multiple tables (if applicable).

2. **DAX Calculations**:
   - Created the following calculated measures and columns:
     - **Sum of Quantity**: `SUM(Orders[Quantity])`
     - **Average Order Value (AOV)**: `DIVIDE(SUM(Orders[Amount]), COUNT(Orders[Order ID]))`
     - **Profit Margin**: `DIVIDE(SUM(Orders[Profit]), SUM(Orders[Amount]))`

All transformations and calculations are stored within the `.pbix` file and can be explored by opening it in Power BI.
